# JSON
<b>JSON Script Repository</b><br>
This is a repository of JSON scripts that I use a lot in my home lab or at the customer site. I'm an IT Pro focussing on Windows, Windows Server, Azure, System Center and Office 365. All scripts are mostly generic with variable settings up near the top or all parameter based.

You can contact me via my website, https://jvrtech.net or via Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JPvR_NL">@JPvR_NL</a>.

The entire risk arising out of the use or performance of the sample scripts and documentation remains with you. In no event shall Jean-Paul van Ravensberg, its authors, or anyone else involved in the creation, production, or delivery of the scripts be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the sample scripts or documentation, even if Jean-Paul van Ravensberg has been advised of the possibility of such damages. While these scripts are tested and working in my environment, it is recommended that you test these scripts in a test environment before using in your production environment.
